/* Commented examples of graph drawing with
 * the koolplot library, version 1.1.
 * Date:	July 2005

The original one required a BGI (Borland Graphics Interface?) library to run.
I removed all dependencies as good as I could and changed to Win32 functions.

Unlike all other my projects, this relies on MSVCR90.DLL and MSVCP90.DLL,
due to heavy use of std::string and std::vector. It is built with MSVC2008.

Koolplot isn't cool, sorry. While it looks easy to use (looks like Matlab?),
it is almost impossible to integrate into existing Win32 projects.
Scale division and space distribution isn't really solved.
No support for multiple axes, and the support for multiple traces is weird.

I have removed the special-code color-change multi-trace option
and decided to allow multiple traces to be Êè≥dded?to one plot,
IMHO much more comprehensible.

heha, August 2019 

Changed to be compileable with good old MSVC6: No "for each".
Compiled with "ddk2003", special depency is now to MSVCP60.DLL.
